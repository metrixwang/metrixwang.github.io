This is the frst course on probability theory, the part of mathematics that studies random phenomena. We model simple random experiments mathematically and learn techniques for studying these models. From a broader intellectual perspective, probability theory is one of the core subject of mathematics with its own distinct style of logical reasoning, which is important for the future study of statistics, econometrics and other courses.
